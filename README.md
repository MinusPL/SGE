THIS VERSION IS OUTDATED AND NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN.
DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN FUN OR LEARNING PURPOSES ON OPEN GL.
NEW VERSION WILL BECOME AVAILABE WHEN I START REWRITE.

WHEN THIS HAPPENS THIS BRANCH WILL BE RENAMED OBSOLETE AND NEW MASTER WILL BE CREATED.

## **UPCOMING CHANGES:**

* Proper model loading with new materials (maybe PBR based)
* Shaders will be added for materials. Object will decide which shader should be used based on material.
* Visualization of objects position in 3D Space (also rotation and scale).
* Improved standard shaders.

**

## IN THE LONG FUTURE:

**
* I'd want to add DirectX renderer to use, but since this whole project is based on OpenGL for now it's impossible, I need to redesign core features to use standarized functions that are not dependent on used renderer.


This is UmiEngine. "SIMPLE" and "GAME" engine that I'm writting to learn about creating games and specifically on how graphics in-game works.
It's not going to be better than any other engine that is already created.
Use however you like any part of code that is created here.
Remember to give credits to authors of each software.
